Above you can see how it looks like. 

To enable it add a `toc` variable to the front matter of your post:

{% highlight md %}
{% raw %}
layout: post
title: Table of content
date:   2018-08-03 11:07
description: For some big articles you can use table on content
toc: true           <=========== this one
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can also customize it by styling `.toc` class in **theme.scss** 

This solution is based on [github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc](https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc).
